    <article class="item">

    <p>Since I've always been interested in computers and technology, I believe the HBO-ICT curriculum is
          a good fit for me. I appreciate making my own projects and learning out how things operate. In addition
        to understanding how systems work, being able to master both the theoretical and practical parts
           of ICT enables me to actually create something with them, which is something I really
            appreciate about it.  Furthermore, I understand that ICT is continually changing, therefore
             I will never become tired and will always be learning new things.</p>

    <h3>I'm particularly interested in the following areas of ICT:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>I'm interested in game design because I've always liked playing games and I want to
         know how they're developed. Not only do i just like games i like problem solving wich is involved in coding.</li>
     <li>Software development, because I like creating programs and seeing my own ideas
         become reality. I enjoy seeing results from your work, it makes me feel proud of
          what i did and happy with what i acomplished.</li>
     <li>Investigating different ICT fields to see what else I might find
         enjoyable in the future. Im interested in exploring and finding
          new things i enjoy this gives me new stuff to think about or do wich is always good.</li>
     </ul>
    <p>HBO-ICT is the best option for me since it combines my interests with practical skills that will be valuable in the future.</p>
