    <h3>Study Choise</h3>
    <p>Before i picked this study i did some study choise activities. I did  a study choise test wich resulted into ICT wich i already somehwat knew without the test
        then i went and visited open days from multiple schools. At first i thought about going to a different
         college in Breda but when i visited the walk-along day from HZ i changed my mind, and wanted to stay close to home for now.
          The other schools i visited didnt care too much about their students like HZ does so that was one of the factors that made me choose HZ aswell.
          What i want to do after this study im not 100% sure about yet and hope to find during my time at HZ.

    <h3>Programming experience</h3>
    <p>I dont have much experience in programming or other ICT activities.
         In high school i did have the subject Informatics wich only did small parts of css, html and python.
          I also had a subject called O&T in high school wich envolved technology but that was also a minimal amount.
           In my free time i did try learning the base of C++ but stopped after it got too hard for me.
            In the end all of the minimal experience that i had faded away after not constantly practising</p>
