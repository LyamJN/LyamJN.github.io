        <p>Mojang Studios is a company i find quite inspiring, they created one of the most sold games of all time,
          Minecraft.
          I personally love Minecraft.
          Minecraft was started bt one single person and over-time became a HUGE game in the industry, seeing how such a
          big
          game can come from one person is the part i find so inspiring.
          Mojang who later bought Minecraft really tries to keep that origin in their game, knowing it came from one
          person
          and they try to keep it that style.
          Mojang has around 700 staff members wich i find quite impressive when their games are massive in scale. They
          have
          allot of different jobs some examples are software developers and engineers for Java and C++ but also data
          analysts
          or marketing positions. I think it would be fun to work at Mojang Studios but challenging. Not only do they
          only
          have 2 places where they work from but getting to a level that high requires allot of skill.</p>
